Frameworks and the like

React created for Facebook, many highly interactive pages

Angular
- avoid AngularJS at all costs
- coded in TypeScript instead of JavaScript
- built of modules containing components and services

React
- released in 2013, created by facebook
- entirely component-based framework, plugins have helped (app tasks, routing, web-workers, etc)
- components created in HTML-ish syntax embedded within normal JavaScript: JSX (JavaScript Extended)
- has 'shadow DOM' resulting in better UI in reactive/interactive situations

Vue
- from anti-React standpoint
- script, template, style
- SFCs - single file components - css, javascript, etc

Svelte **
- SFCs are created in .svelte files: script, style, everything else
- better performance than either because it doesn't have a 'shadow DOM'
- his favorite - so easy, black magic
